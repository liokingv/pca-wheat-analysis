This project utilizes the wheat variety dataset from the UCI data repository. In this repo, I perform principal component analysis to analyze feature importance in the three wheat varieties represented. I concluded that the first three principal components capture virtually all variability and all features are important enough to keep for the cluster analysis. 

For the cluster analysis, I took the gap statistic as the basis for my k-cluster selection criteria which ended up being three clusters. Then I plot the clusters with the principal components serinv as the axes. Includes a 2D and a 3D plot.

The full write up with academic sources is included in this repo.
